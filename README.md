# Image_Fog_Removal
Remove fog from singel image. For images take in fog weather, my peoject implemented several methods 
that can remove the fog and recover the clear scene. 

You need to install OpenCV to run the code 

Some of the methods take reference of the following papers: 
1. Kaiming He, Jian Sun, Xiaoou Tang. "Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2010. 
2. Kaiming He, Jian Sun, Xiaoou Tang. "Guided Image Filtering". IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2012.
